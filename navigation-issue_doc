Subject: Internet Explorer 8 NAVIGATION BAR DISPLAY ISSUE - hidden behind top image
Importance: High
 
Good morning **REMOVED NAME FOR PRIVACY**,
 
The new [WEBSITE NAME HERE] page looks nice! 
ONE ISSUE: I’m sure you noticed, but with [COMPANY NAME] being on INTERNET EXPLORER 8 (behind), the DROP –DOWN MENU is HIDING BEHIND the top Welcome Message Image. . .
 
Some possible solutions to fix this:
Below are some code (CSS) fixes –others out there have the same issue with their websites in OLDER WEB BROWSERS. . .
 
POSSIBLE 2 SOLUTIONS: 
1) They may need to position the top banner photo (Welcome Image) with a NEGATIVE Z-NUMBER. . .
2) They may need to add the CSS STYLE= “position: relative;” to the navigation menu
 

 
SUGGESTIONS BELOW:
 
//The CURRENT NAVIGATION .CSS
//There is a Z-Index of 2 – but the NAVIGATION needs to have POSITION: RELATIVE; for the sub-navigation elements. . .
 
//YOUR CSS FOR THE NAVIGATION
#navlist > li > a{
        font-size: 16px;
}
.nav ul li{
        z-index: 4;
}
ul#navlist li:hover ul,
ul#navlist li:hover ul li,
ul#navlist li:hover ul li a
{
        display: block;
        float:none;
        z-index:2;
        max-width:250px;
(insert)position: relative; //maybe try adding this position to the nav?
}

//YOUR CSS FOR THE TOP BANNER IMAGE (“Welcome Image”?)
}
/*
slider/banner
*/
.desktoponly .banner-slide{
        position: relative;
}
.desktoponly .slide-username{
        position: absolute;
        left: 50%;
        top: 160px;
        right: 0;
        /*width: 350px;*/
        font-size: 40px;
        z-index: 1; //MAY NEED TO CHANGE THE BANNER IMAGE AT TOP TO A NEGATIVE (-1) Z-INDEX?
        color: white;
        font-weight: lighter;
}
